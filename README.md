# F1 Team Customizer / Fantasy Career Mode

* Our web app will be a F1 Team Creator. The user will be able to customize his team from the ground-up (team name, livery, engine supplier, main sponsor, drivers,
team principal, engineer team, home track). The user will have an allocated budget to create his team with, and will only have one team per account.

* We will also try to implement a livery customizer, for the user to be able to design his dream F1 livery, including color schemes and previously selected sponsors.

* All the drivers will have 'descriptions', containing their DoB, PoB, Best Race Finish and a short background. The user can choose from different storylines so that he could create the history of the team, depending on the the team name he chose (If he chooses a default team, he will have the team background. Otherwise, he will be able to select the story he likes best.)

* We wish to implement a F1 Race Simulator at the end of the project (optional).
